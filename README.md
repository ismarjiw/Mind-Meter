## Project Description
Mind Meter is a web app that helps users log timed meditation sessions, write journal reflections, and listen to calming music all in one space! Users start by creating an account and logging into their profile page. From there, they can choose to start a 5 or 10 minute meditation. While they're meditating, the user also has the option to listen to 4 different sound buttons ranging from rain sounds to etheral beats. If they have a Spotify account, they may also choose to listen to a curated meditation playlist as well. After they meditate, the user can write a journal reflection recording any revelations, thoughts or feelings they had during their meditation session. In addition, there is a handy focused breathing animation the user can reference to help with breath control during medtation. As well, to see if it would be a good day to go for a walk or not, by entering their zipcode, the user can check to see what their local weather is (weather info coming from Open Weather's API). And finally, the user can reference a bar graph charting what days they've meditated and for how long.

With Mind Meter, anyone can start their meditation journey!
