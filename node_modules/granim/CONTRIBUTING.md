# Contributing

As `granim.js` is a small project with a few maintainers,
we'd like to make sure that it's easy for you to contribute,
and that it's easy for us to manage incoming PRs. In that interest -

1. Fork the Repo
2. Clone
3. Run `npm install`
4. Add test cases and make changes to pass those tests
5. You can also test your modifications with the `test/` folder
6. Run `gulp` or `gulp watch` to build / watch the lib. Use `gulp buildDoc` or `gulp watchDoc` to build / watch the docs
7. Run `npm start` and check `localhost:8080` to access the doc locally, everything should be working after your changes
8. Run `npm test` and make sure the tests pass
9. Commit the source and the built files and Push
10. Open a Pull Request

### Before you commit

* If you modified the lib:
1. Run `gulp` and commit the modifications and the built lib (`dist/granim.js`, `dist/granim.min.js`, `docs/assets/js/vendor/granim.min.js`)
2. Run `npm test` to make sure you past test cases. **Please add test cases** for your new code

* If you modified the docs:
1. Use the `docs/assets/pug/*.pug` to modify the HTML of the docs, and commit the .pug and .html built file
2. For .js and .css modifications, commit the source and the built files

**Please commit your modifications with a clear message of what you changed/added.
The sources and the built files should be in the same commit**.

### Guidelines

We'd like to make sure your code is like our:

1. `'use strict';`
2. Use semicolons `;`
3. We prefer `'` to `"`
4. Use 1 tab for indentation, no spaces
5. The lib is coded in ES5, for code consistency, don't use ES6 please

With all of that, you should have a PR submitted and merged in no time.

Thanks for helping us out! :)

### Test

Run `npm test`

We have CI and code coverage set up for the project, and testing is very important to us. We want to make sure your contributions help everyone without hurting them
